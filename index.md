# Introduction/Background

# Problem definition
Given the World Sustainability Dataset we want to cluster countries by relevant features that correspond to the economic, environmental, and social prosperity of the country. (Note: these categories of prosperity are not comprehensive and are subject to change) Determining which columns from this dataset correspond to these categories will be a preprocessing step we must do before. Once these clusters are created we want to map the country codes from each cluster to their geographic location and notice correlation between location and any of categories of prosperity. Once a relationship is determined we can use these findings to understand which parts of the world perform best and worst in certain areas. In doing so we can take proper steps to accurately address the shortcomings of countries that are not prospering. Additionally, because some of the data is chronological we can potentially predict a country becoming an outlier in their cluster, and if this is in a negative direction, our findings can help inform which sectors of prosperity must be worked on.
